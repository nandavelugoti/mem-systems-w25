<h1 id="ece-4-599-modern-memory-systems">ECE 4/599: Modern Memory Systems</h1>
<p>(Please first read the formal syllabus on <a href="https://canvas.oregonstate.edu/courses/1995803/assignments/syllabus">Canvas</a>.)</p>
<p>This is an undergraduate/graduate level, research-intensive course in computer
systems, with a focus on techniques and technologies that enable today’s
high-performance memory systems.</p>
<h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>
<p>We will use Discord for course communication, and <a href="https://github.com/khale/mem-systems-w25/discussions">GitHub</a> for online paper and lesson
discussions. You can find the Discord server sign-up link in a Canvas announcement.</p>
<h2 id="class-sessions">Class Sessions</h2>
<p>Check the <a href="https://khale.github.io/mem-systems-w25/schedule/">schedule</a> for each day of class. Class sections will typically (though not always)
involve a first part where I lecture, and a second part where you present papers and we all
discuss them.</p>
<p>You are expected to do the relevant readings <strong>before</strong> class so that everyone can participate.</p>
<h2 id="work-you-ll-be-doing">Work You’ll Be Doing</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>Paper reading:</em>
We’ll be reading a lot of research papers, and we’ll be discussing them both asynchronously online (GitHub/Discord) and syncronously during class discussions.</li>
<li><em>Blog contributions:</em>
You’ll be writing summaries, critiques, and discussion notes in the form of blog posts for each paper we cover in class. This will be a team effort.</li>
<li><em>Course project:</em>
The biggest part of your grade will be an open-ended, ambitious, research project that culminates in a codebase, a presentation, and a final blog post. This will also be a team effort.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="paper-reading-discussion">Paper Reading &amp; Discussion</h3>
<p>Most of our in-class time will be spent discussing research papers.
When we read a paper, you will need to participate in online and in person.</p>
<h4 id="if-you-are-the-paper-leader">If you are the paper leader</h4>
<ul>
<li>One week before we discuss the paper, create a discussion thread for the paper in GitHub <a href="https://github.com/khale/mem-systems-w25/discussions/categories/paper-discussions">discussions</a>.</li>
<li>Watch the discussion thread and answer any questions you can</li>
<li>Work with your lab to assign the roles of blogger/reviewer and scribe.</li>
<li>Present a few slides (~10 is good, more is okay) on the paper and lead the in-class discussion. If the paper
already has a slide deck available online, feel free to use that, or a subset of it.</li>
<li>Gather everyone’s work from your lab no later than one week from discussion day into a blog post on the <a href="https://github.com/khale/mem-systems-w25">website github</a>.
Make clear everyone’s roles. You submit the blog post via a pull request to the github site.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Everyone must be a paper leader at least once.</strong></p>
<h4 id="if-you-are-in-the-presentation-group">If you are in the presentation group</h4>
<ul>
<li>Blogger/Reviewer: submit a summary of the paper (and your interpretations/opinions/thoughts about it)
to the paper leader. It should include
<ul>
<li>Background you think the audience needs to understand the paper</li>
<li>Detailed summary of the main contributions of the paper. Don’t just summarize; include your thoughts</li>
<li>Important results and what they mean</li>
<li>Context of where the work fits in and why it’s important for the field.</li>
<li>Identify strengths and weaknesses of the paper (both those you’ve identified, and those
identified by others in in-class and online discussions)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scribe: Take good notes of the in-class discussion and submit to the blogger to include in the blog post</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Everyone must take on each of these roles at least once.</strong></p>
<h4 id="everyone">Everyone</h4>
<p>Participate in the online and in-class discussions. Once the paper leader has created the discussion thread,
give your thoughts on the paper. This does not need to be long, just a few senetences is okay. You can
also respond to others’ posts, and this counts as well.</p>
<h3 id="research-project">Research Project</h3>
<p>You will do a systems implementation research project that will involve a significant amount of
systems building and coding. This can be any open-ended and open-source project you choose that
is related to memory systems. This could involve OS, compiler, hardware, and programming language work.
The final product is a blog post, your code, and a presentation.</p>
<p>You can either work individually or in groups with up to 2-3 people.</p>
<h4 id="proposal">Proposal</h4>
<p>You must first submit a project proposal. This is due on Friday, January 17 (at the end of week two). I
will post a list of project ideas soon, though you are free to come up with your own ideas. <a href="https://github.com/khale/mem-systems-w25/issues/new?labels=proposal&amp;template=project-proposal.md&amp;title=Project+%5BNUMBER%5D+Proposal%3A+%5BTITLE%5D">Open a GitHub issue</a>
answering these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What will you do?</li>
<li>How will you do it?</li>
<li>How will you empirically measure success?</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also list the GitHub usernames of everyone in the group.</p>
<p>After you submit the PR on GitHub, submit its URL to the “Project Proposal” assignment on Canvas. I will give
feedback on GitHub on the project.</p>
<h4 id="implementation">Implementation</h4>
<p>Create a plan for implementing the different parts of your system. Large systems will always have to be
broken down into smaller pieces. Build the skeleton code first, then work from there.</p>
<h4 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h4>
<p>In your evaluation, think about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What benchmarks will you use?</li>
<li>How do you test for correctness?</li>
<li>How will you measure success? What will your figures of merit be?</li>
<li>How will you present your results and findings?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can look to SIGPLAN’s <a href="https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/EmpiricalEvaluation/">empirical evaluation guidelines</a> for
hints on how to do this well.</p>
<h4 id="final-report">Final Report</h4>
<p>For the final report, you’ll summarize your project’s outcomes, findings, and results in the form of a post on the <a href="https://khale.github.io/mem-systems-w25/blog/">course blog</a>.
Your writeup should answer these questions in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was the goal?</li>
<li>What did you do? (include both the design and the implementation.)</li>
<li>What were the hardest parts to get right?</li>
<li>What was surprising?</li>
<li>Were you successful? (Report rigorously on your empirical evaluation.)</li>
</ul>
<p>You are welcome to optionally include a video to go along with your blog post.</p>
<p>To submit your report, open a pull request in <a href="https://github.com/khale/mem-systems-w25">the course’s GitHub repository</a> to add your post to the blog.
In your PR description, please include “closes #N” where N is the issue number for your proposal.
The repository’s README relevant has instructions.</p>
